# intro
As you may know, efforts have been made to make improvements to the autosplitter. The splitter did not work for the cracked version of the game, and not for the remastered version either. Support for these have now been added. The splitter would not properly reattach to the game after restarting it - it will now. I think that these fixes will solve a lot of the inconsistencies that people seem to have. This version [should just work](https://imgur.com/hguyOjZ) - but only time will tell, so fingers crossed.

This readme is a basic instruction for everyone that would like to take this version for a spin before it is officially released. It would be greatly appreciated if you took it for a spin and reported any issues you may find.

# installation
You now require 2 files to be installed - [LiveSplit.DarkSouls.dll](https://github.com/Grimelios/LiveSplit.DarkSouls/blob/remastered/Components/LiveSplit.DarkSouls.dll) and [DarkSoulsMemory.dll](https://github.com/Grimelios/LiveSplit.DarkSouls/blob/remastered/Components/DarkSoulsMemory.dll). Click on them to download them (download button on the right). Both these files have to be copied into the livesplit\components folder. Doing this will overwrite the existing installation, to undo it, you'll have to remove these 2 files and reinstall 1.1.4. When this version is officially released, livesplit will automatically update existing installations, no files would have to manually be installed.

While I've tested a bunch, it would still be wise to make a backup of your splits and layout file before you install this.

# bugs/troubleshooting

Anything that does not behave the way you expect it, no matter if it is a known issue, please report it eiter via an issue on github, or find me on discord (wasted#2747). I have worked on this for 2 weeks so I have no idea about any historical issues beyond what I've been told - can easily have missed something. Just let me know about them and I'll look into fixing them. This also applies for troubleshooting with the installation, just shoot me a message and I'll see what I can do to help you.
